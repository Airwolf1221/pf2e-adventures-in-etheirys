# 0.5 Release
All content aside from classes and class feats are in! Completely with significant background work to implement various systems such as the total conversion aspects, mythic rules and so on. All that remains are the classes.

# 0.1 Release
Very first 'proper' module version! All ancestry feats + heritages are in, plus most of the backend work for renaming vanilla PF2e content.
