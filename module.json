These abilities can be affected by a dispel effect, or by an antimagic field, just like they were a spell.

Though this device's exact shape and size varies, the classic appearance is that of a small, waist-mounted box, sometimes affectionately referred to as a Lunch Box.\nRegardless of its appearance, your aetherotransformer stores overcharge points in a manner that isn't dissimilar from Focus Points; when you gain a feat with the amp or overcharge traits, you gain one aetheric charge that your aetherotransformer stores, up to a maximum of 3 charges. Your Focus Points are tallied independently of aetheric charges.\nAetheric charges are recovered just like Focus Points, through the Refocus action, doing activities related to your engineering invention. Focus Points cannot be used to activate overcharge abilities, and aetheric charges cannot be used to activate focus spells unless you gain the ability to do so through feats.\nSome actions with the AMP trait also list an Overcharge function, which you can spend an aetheric charge to activate when using the action. If you cannot spend an aetheric charge on the action, you can still use the ability normally, but cannot activate the overcharge function.\nLike spells, some abilities with the AMP trait get stronger as you increase in level. In these cases, the ability ends in one or more “Level” entries. This either lists the particular levels at which the ability gets an upgrade, or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level action with a “Level (+4)” entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels."
