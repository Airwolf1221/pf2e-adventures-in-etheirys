      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> It is your turn, you meet a condition determined by your limit style, and you are not currently under the effects of one of your limit breaks.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> a number of times per day equal to your Limit Rank</p><hr /><p>You lash out with a surge of adrenaline, pushing beyond your normal limits. You may use one of your known Limit Break feats.</p><p>Some Limit Breaks require saving throws from enemies. These saving throws use your class DC or spellcasting DC, whichever is higher, and will be called Limit Break DCs.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> While the Limit Break activity is a free action, the limit breaks themselves have their own action costs. Generally, 1st rank limit breaks take 1 action, while 2nd and 3rd rank limit breaks take 2 actions, and 4th rank limit breaks take 3 actions and are only usable once per day, regardless of your Limit Rank.</p>",
