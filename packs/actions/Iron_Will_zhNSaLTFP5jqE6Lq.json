Choose an enemy within 30 feet to be your provoked enemy. If your provoked enemy takes a hostile action that includes at least one of your allies but doesn't include you, they take a -1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls and DCs for that action, and they also become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} until the start of their next turn.</p><p>Your enemy remains provoked until the start of your next turn, and you can have only one Iron Will in effect at a time.
