      "value": "<p>You can deliver a fierce uppercut with your grafted arm, allowing you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity. Make an unarmed Strike, applying any runes affixed to your grafted arm. On a success, the Strike deals an additional @Damage[1d12[electricity]] damage to the target, as well as @Damage[1d4[electricity]] damage to up to two other foes within 10 feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your grafted arm Strike, you take @Damage[1d12[electricity]] damage. You then reduce the operational time of your grafted arm by an hour.</p><p>This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. At 18th level, the additional @Localize[PF2E.TraitElectricity] damage to the target increases to 2d12, and the additional @Localize[PF2E.TraitElectricity] damage to the other foes increases to 2d4.</p>",
