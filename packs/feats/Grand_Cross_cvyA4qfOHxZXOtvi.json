Make a Strike with your held weapon at an enemy within the Limit Break’s range, dealing normal weapon damage and an additional @Damage[(3 * @actor.flags.pf2e.limit-rank)d12[vitality]] damage. This attack deals the damage of a standard hit even on a critical success, and does not trigger critical effects.</p><p>The holy energy surges to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can't target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all targets. Roll to hit separately for each target, but roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target (halving or doubling as appropriate for your attack roll’s outcome). The chain ends if you critically fail to hit one of the targets.</p><p>The chain continues even if you regularly fail, instead only dealing half of your rolled damage before jumping on to the next target.</p>",
