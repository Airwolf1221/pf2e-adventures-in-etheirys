Your skysteel multi-tool must have a weapon trait that matches the action you chose (for instance, to choose Grapple, your weapon must have the grapple trait).</p><p>You take the chosen action against the same foe as your previous successful Strike, using the same multiple attack penalty as your previous successful Strike. You still increase your multiple attack penalty after the Grapple, Shove, or Trip, as normal.</p>",
