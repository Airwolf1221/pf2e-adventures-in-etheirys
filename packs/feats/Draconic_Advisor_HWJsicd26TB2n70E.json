      "value": "<p>While it isn't widely known, your homeland has an intense connection to dragons - with one residing in your homeland itself. As a result you know how to work well with the creatures.</p><p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression} on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.cc8O47KFsODReoBe]{Glad-Hand} skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.</p>",
