Make a Strike against all creatures in the line. On a successful hit, in addition to its normal effects, you deal an additional @Damage[8d8] damage matching your weapon's damage. At the end of the Strikes, move to the other end of the line, and you may start the process again, choosing a new direction for the line to travel and repeating the effects of the limit break, ending the effect once you reach the end of this line.</p><p>You can only target a given creature once, regardless of how many times you pass through their square. You can end the chain at any time, but if you critically fail on an attack roll the chain ends automatically. If this limit break ends due to critically failing the attack roll, you still move to the end of the 30-foot line to resolve it.</p>",
