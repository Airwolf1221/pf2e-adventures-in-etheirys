      "value": "<p>Installing a series of powerful magnetic gadgets and fields in your firearm's barrel or your arrow’s rest, you charge your invention with lightning before firing a powerful shot. Make a ranged strike with your invention, doubling your invention’s range increment. On a hit, the target takes normal damage, plus an additional 1d4 points of lightning damage for each die of damage your invention deals.</p><hr /><p><strong>Overcharge Function</strong> The damage dice for the additional lightning damage increases to 1d8. Your ammunition retains the magnet's charge, creating a brief magnetic field around the target. The target takes @Damage[(max(1, floor(@actor.level/2)))[persistent,electricity]] damage equal to half your level. For as long as the target is taking this persistent damage, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to all attack rolls against the target with metal weapons or effects with the lightning trait, and the target takes a –1 status penalty to all saving throws against effects with the lightning trait.</p>",
