Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. This counts as three attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. This strike gains the following effects.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You deal twice the weapon's normal damage, plus the precision damage from hakaze (@Damage[(floor((@actor.level - 4)/3) + 2)d6[precision]]).</p><p><strong>Success</strong> You deal the weapon's normal damage</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> You deal half of the weapon's normal damage.</p><hr /><p>So long as the attack is not a critical failure, the target must also make a @Check[fortitude|against:class|traits:death] save. Regardless of its result, it is then immune to midare setsugekka's save effects for 24 hours. This effect has the death trait.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> If the target has more than three quarters of its maximum HP (rounded down), its current HP is reduced to that amount.
