Make a ranged Strike at an enemy within your weapon’s first range increment. If this Strike hits, in addition to its normal effects, it continues going into an enemy behind them. The attack continues moving in a line that is 60 feet long and originates from the target, striking enemies behind them. Compare your attack roll to the AC of any creatures behind the target in a line, if you would hit but not critically hit that enemy, you deal half of your Strike damage to them as well. If you would critically hit them, you deal the damage of a standard hit to that target. If that enemy is size Large or larger, double the damage dealt by Desperado to them.</p>",
