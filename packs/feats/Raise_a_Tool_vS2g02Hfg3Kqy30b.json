The tool remains raised until the start of your next turn. While you have a tool raised, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, as well as a +1 circumstance bonus to Strikes made with weapons matching any of your Hand feats. If one of your Hand feats grants proficiency with a category of armor and you're wearing armor of that category, the circumstance bonus to AC increases to +2.</p><p>If you have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block}, you can use the tool for that feat (Hardness 3, HP 12, BT 6) as though it were a shield. Whenever you use an ability that allows you to Raise a Shield, such as Emergency Touch, you can Raise a Tool instead, changing any requirements that normally require a shield to apply to your tool.</p>",
