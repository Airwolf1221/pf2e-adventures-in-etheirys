You can use this ability to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.</p><hr /><p><strong>Overcharge Function</strong> Your armor charges with power, carrying you forward at a speed that's probably still safe. You can use Magitek Rush as a single action. You can expend two charges to gain the follow effect:</p><ul><li><p>As you charge forward, your armor discharges power around you. All creatures you pass within 5 feet of during the movement granted by Magitek Rush takes @Damage[(2 + (floor((@actor.level - 1)/2)))d6[fire]] damage, with a @Check[reflex|against:engineer|basic] save against your class DC. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter. Creatures only make this save once, even if you pass by them multiple times.</p></li></ul>",
