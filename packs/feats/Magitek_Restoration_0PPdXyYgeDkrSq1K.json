You create a minor explosion from your invention, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains @Damage[max(1,ceil(@actor.level/2))d10[healing]] Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.</p><p>At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special </strong>If your invention is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.</p>",
