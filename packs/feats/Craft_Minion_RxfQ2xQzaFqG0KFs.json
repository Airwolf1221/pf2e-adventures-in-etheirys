You must meet all normal requirements for that familiar, such as the minimum number of abilities. You may change your familiar into any of these specific familiars by spending 1 day of downtime.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> This feat is incompatible with the familiar granted by the entwined souls discipline.
