      "value": "<p>While the blessing of light manifests differently for everyone, you have one of the more 'well-known' manifestations of its presence; the Echo. Whenever you are in the presence of a creature with a pertinent, storied past in relation to the current events you are a part of - determined by the GM - the GM rolls a secret @Check[perception|traits:secret] check against a standard difficulty DC check for your level. You can expend a Hero Point to have this check rolled with Mythic Proficiency.</p><p>On a success, your vision fades and you get a splitting headache, as you experience a vision imparted by the echo in shocking clarity, detailing a point in time in the creature's history of the GM's choice; this vision could be from a third person angle, or it could be from the perspective of the creature.</p><p>Time almost seems to stop while you experience the vision, and when it concludes only a few seconds have passed for everyone else.</p>",
