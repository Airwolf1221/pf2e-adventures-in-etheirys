Oh, you'll give them a distraction, all right! Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature with a weapon or unarmed attack that is benefiting from your aetheric boost. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p><hr /><p><strong>Overcharge Function</strong> You pull out all the stops to create an explosive distraction. Add the amp and overcharge traits to Distracting Detonation. If the attack hits, you disrupt the triggering concentrate action.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If your invention is a minion, it can take this reaction instead of you, even though minions can't normally take reactions or act when it's not their turn. It uses your reaction for the turn to do so.</p>",
