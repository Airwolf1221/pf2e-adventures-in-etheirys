You and all allies within the Limit Break’s area of effect reduce the value of all negative conditions (except for Wounded and Doomed) by 1, and immediately stop any source of persistent damage whose source is not actively still ongoing (for example, this Limit Break could put someone out who is on fire, but would not protect someone who is currently standing in fire).</p>",
