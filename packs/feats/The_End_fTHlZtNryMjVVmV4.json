Once each round on the ceature's turn, it can spend 3 actions to attempt a @Check[type:survival|against:limit-dc] or @Check[type:perception|against:limit-dc] check against your Limit Break DC to escape the fantasy. The target's body still remains in the prime material while it is in the mindscape, allowing attacks to be made against it, but it gains resistance to all damage equal to its level and is immune to any mental and emotion effects while The End is active on it.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.feat-effects.Item.xJIld2LDomUeNjS3]{Effect: The End}</p><p>Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When the limit break ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to reality as it were, and may continue fighting as usual. The possible outcomes are as follows.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target escapes and the limit break ends.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The target begins to resist the fantasy. If the target was already resisting, it escapes the maze and the limit break ends.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The target makes no progress toward escape.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target makes no progress toward escape, and if it was resisting, it no longer is.</p>",
