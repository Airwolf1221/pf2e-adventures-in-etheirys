      "value": "<p>You aggregate the effects of other magitek inventions into your mech, allowing you to use them with the mech. You can ignore the magitek armor and skysteel multi-tool invention requirements of engineer feats that are more than 2 levels below your current level, though you must still meet other prerequisites. This feat does not let you take those feats as magitek pilot feats, it just loosens that specific restriction.</p><p>You apply feats that require the magitek armor invention to your mech's armor, and feats that require the skysteel multi-tool to either your mech's primary or secondary weapon, of your choice, but never to your multi-tool.</p><p>You can change which unarmed attack such a feat applies to during your daily preparations, or via the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.class-features.Item.uRKfgpChuQ5HsLzD]{Engineering Reconfiguration} class feature.</p>",
