Target a creature other than yourself who is also within your paladin's aura. Until the start of your next turn, and while they remain inside your paladin's aura, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC. If they have Raised a Shield, they instead increase the circumstance bonus granted by their shield by 1.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.feat-effects.Item.p112KgTN2MDYww43]{Effect: Ward of Empathy}</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the Wards of Devotion feat, this feat affects all allies in your paladin's aura and persists for the full duration even if they leave your aura, but overrides wards of devotion's bonus to AC while active.</p>",
