Make a @Check[crafting|dc:@self.level|adjustment:2] check against a hard DC of your level.</p><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You are reduced to 1 Hit Point, and your mech is able to keep running. You immediately gain temporary Hit Points equal to a quarter of your level (minimum 1 temp HP) that last for 1 round.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> You are reduced to 1 Hit Point, but your mech is not so fortunate. You automatically eject from your mech, but it does not become Dying, it just becomes broken.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You make a calamitous error that premature detonates your mech. You automatically eject from your mech, which is immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points and is destroyed.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.feat-effects.Item.lzXIRzJGdFsiMe7K]{Effect: Emergency Repair Matrix}</p><hr /><p><strong>Overcharge Function</strong> You can deploy all sorts of last minute defensive measures to keep your mech intact, at great strain to your aetherotransformer. You must expend at least two aetheric charges to use this function. Add the amp and overcharge traits to emergency repair matrix, and you automatically gain the critical success effect. If you instead expend three charges, you are reduced to your level in Hit Points, and immediately gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level instead.</p>",
