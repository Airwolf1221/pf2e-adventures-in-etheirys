Either your construct or you (if you're adjacent to it) can Collapse your Construct to turn it into its compact form or back into its normal form.</p><p>In compact form, your construct can't act but is easily carried, with a Bulk of 2 if it's Small, 4 if it's Medium, or 8 if it's Large. The compact form has wheels, so you can easily drag it behind you at half your Speed (rather than the usual slower Speed for dragging).</p>",
