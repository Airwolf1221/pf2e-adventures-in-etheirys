      "value": "<p>Some say the echo is a curse, and maybe it is, but it can do very potent things, and your mastery of it has reached the point where you can draw memories of an area to the surface and glimpse recent events. When you Cast the Spell, you fix your mind on an amount of time in the past, up to 24 hours ago, or up to a month ago if you expend a Hero Point.</p><p>Your vision fades as the familiar pang of the echo fills your mind, and you are shown a grainy scene of the events that took place at that time within 120 feet of the location you chose.</p><p>The images are unfortunately not all that detailed; they are a translucent white colour and detailed enough to show a silhouette, outline, or contour of creatures and objects that passed through the area and the motions they took. Fine details - such as facial details and written letters - are too precise for your limited mastery of the echo to form, and the scene lacks sound.</p><p>You can Sustain the spell to cause the echo to play events backward or forward, with each minute spent Sustaining corresponding to a minute of playback.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can share the vision granted by Lesser Echo with up to 5 other creatures. Additionally, the vision no longer lacks sound.</p><p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> You can share the vision granted by Lesser Echo with up to 10 other creatures. Additionally, all flaws of the vision are not present; you can see fine details and you can hear the sound of the scene. Finally, the maximum sustain duration increases to 30 minutes.</p>"
