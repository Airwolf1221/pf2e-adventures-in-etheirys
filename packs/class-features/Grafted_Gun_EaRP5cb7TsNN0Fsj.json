      "value": "<p>You obtain a grafted arm prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your grafted arm can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as your literal arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increase your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p><p>Your grafted arm prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a grafted ranged attack that is in the firearm weapon group.</p><p>You have several options to customize your grafted arm. First, choose whether you have a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.equipment.Item.VAzPbTD2tDY5VPfj]{grafted arm cannon}, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the capacity 3, combination, concussive, fatal d10, and shove traits; a range of 80 feet, and a reload of 1, or a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-adventures-in-etheirys.equipment.Item.WosSPXx2btm4A8MX]{gatling grafted arm}, which deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and has the combination, repeating, automatic and fatal d8 traits; a range of 60 feet, and a reload of 0. Both grafted arms' melee attack is in the brawling group, deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and has the unarmed and critical fusion traits.</p><p>Most grafted arms are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use. However, you can instead choose to make your grafted arm be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled grafted arm, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size for the ranged attack, to a 1d8 for a grafted arm cannon or 1d6 for a gatling grafted arm. Grafted arms affixed to the hand are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the gun when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p><p>You need to keep your grafted arm wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous. If you spend 1 minute winding up your arm, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.cYdz2grcOcRt4jk6]{Disable} the grafted arm, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the arm's remaining operational time. When your grafted arm is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your grafted arm ranged attack or any other abilities from this style until you wind the arm again.</p>",
