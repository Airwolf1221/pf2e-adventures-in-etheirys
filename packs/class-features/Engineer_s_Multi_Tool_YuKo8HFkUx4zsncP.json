      "value": "<p>As part of entering into the line of work of an engineer, all students have to first build their multi-tool - a powerful, engineer-exclusive weapon built from the ground up to suit you. You start play with a multi-tool built from the options outlined in the Engineer's Multi-Tool section. To build your multi-tool, go through each step of the multi-tool section one at a time.</p><p>You have <strong>6 Tool Points</strong> (referred to going forward as <strong>TP</strong>) which you can use to design your multi-tool, but your major engineering invention might grant you more. Your magitek tool is a very interesting innovation indeed, and as you develop it you empower it more. You can only have a single multi-tool, unless you later gain a feat that allows you to create more.</p><p>You can freely upgrade and reconfigure your multi-tool's <strong>TP</strong> investments, so long as you do not remove traits it was given for free from other sources.</p><p>If your tool is two-handed, it has <strong>2 Bulk</strong>. Otherwise, it has <strong>1 Bulk</strong>. You are not bound to the decisions you made when you created your tool, and you can restructure it and reallocate its TP freely by using a full 6 hours of the <strong>Craft Project</strong> activity from <strong>Complete Crafting Overhaul</strong>. If your GM is not using CCO, instead you spend a full day of downtime.</p>",
