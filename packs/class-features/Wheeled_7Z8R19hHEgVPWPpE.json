Your magitek's Speed increases to 40 feet, and it gains the effect of Vehicle Momentum. You can lower the dimensions of your mech to a 5-foot width and a 10-foot length, narrowing its profile.</p><p>Your mech can seat multiple other creatures as passengers, up to one creature per square your mech occupies. These creatures take a circumstance penalty on all attack rolls equal to the number of creatures currently riding your mech. A creature can spend a single action to negate this penalty until the start of their next turn.</p><p>If you take this modification, you cannot take the Enhanced Locomotion modification.</p>"
