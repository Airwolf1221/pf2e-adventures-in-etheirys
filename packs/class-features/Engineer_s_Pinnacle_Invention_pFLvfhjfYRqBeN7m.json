During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your invention if it's destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different invention (magitek armor, skysteel multi-tools, magitech mechs, and magitek pawns) and change your modifications.</p><p>If you have any feats that had your previous invention as a prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your new invention as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.</p>",
