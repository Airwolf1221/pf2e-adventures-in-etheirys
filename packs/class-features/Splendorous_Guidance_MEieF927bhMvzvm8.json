If they're a spontaneous spellcaster, they can treat any disciple spell you have prepared as a known spell, as if it were in their normal spell list. If they're a prepared spellcaster, they can expend one of their prepared spells to cast a disciple spell you have prepared in the same rank; this doesn't expend your prepared spell.</p>",
