      "value": "<p>You’ve become attuned to the cycle of elements, weaving them into your crafting, casting, and combat style. Your key attribute is Intelligence, and you become trained in Arcana. You cast black magic spells rather than arcanima spells.</p><p>Your connection with the elements extends far beyond the preferred element of your gift. You gain 2 additional spell slots each day at your lowest rank of disciple spell slots. You can prepare only spells with elemental traits in these slots, but these spells can’t share any elemental traits with each other or your gift's preferred element.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Elemental Traits</strong> are quantified as the earth, lightning, water, fire, ice, or wind traits.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Discipline Student (Anemos Logos):</strong> Whenever you cast a spell with an elemental trait, your Strikes deal an additional 1d6 damage of that element per spell rank until the end of your next turn. If you cast another such spell during this time, you only use the highest such bonus. This deals d8s instead if your weapon has the mystic trait.</p><p><strong>Discipline Apprentice (Pagos Magia):</strong> Choose two elements. You gain two special 2nd-rank spell slots, in which you can only prepare spells with those elemental traits. The spells prepared in these slots can't share any elemental traits with each other.</p><p><strong>Discipline Journeyman (Pyros Logos):</strong> You can safely use wands an additional time per day each, but only if the spell cast from that wand has an elemental trait. When you Strike with a staff, it gains the mystic trait for that attack, and you deal additional damage equal to the number of charges it has remaining. This damage is of an element of your choice from among the elemental traits of the spells within that staff; if no spells in the staff have elemental traits, you don't deal any additional damage.</p><p><strong>Discipline Mentor (Hydatos Magia):</strong> The special 2nd-rank slots from your pagos magia ability increase to 4th-rank, and you gain 2 more such slots. Choose 2 more elements, which can't be the same as those chosen for your pagos magia ability.</p><p><strong>Discipline Leader (Eureka Magia):</strong> The special 4th-rank slots from your pagos magia and hydatos magia abilities increase to 6th-rank, and you gain 2 more such slots. Choose 2 more elements, which can't be the same as those chosen for your pagos magia or hydatos magia abilities.</p><p><strong>Discipline Grandmaster (Physeos Logos):</strong> You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell with an elemental trait in that slot using gift of magic. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots (other than cyclical elements) or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Immaculate Gift feat to gain a second slot, subject to the same restrictions.</p>",
